Provide instructions on how to compile and run your code, especially if you used a nonstandard Makefile, or you are one of those hackers who insists on doing things differently.

Open asst8.vcxproj in VS and run the solution with Local Windows Debugger on Release Mode

Indicate if you met all problem set requirements (more importantly, let us know where your bugs are and what you did to try to eliminate the bugs; we want to give you as much partial credit as we can).

I believe I have completed all requirements.

Provide some overview of the code design. Don't go into details; just give us the big picture.

I implemented the functions from the code snippets as described in the assigment.

Let us know how to run the program; what are the hot keys, mouse button usage, and so on? Describe steps or sequences of steps the TF should take to test and evaluate your code (especially if your implmenentation strays from the assignment specification).

Press P to and click the bunny to select it. Then move the bunny around with the mouse to watch the fur move.

Finally, did you implement anything above and beyond the problem set? If so, document it in order for the TFs to test it and evaluate it.
